Q1. What is the concept of a metaclass?
Answer:
In python everything is associated with type. In other programming languages, int, str, array are data type.
But, in python, they are objects of the class int, str, list, dict. We can create user defined type by creating a class 
and then object of that class.
A Class is also an object, and just like any other object itâ€™s a instance of something called Metaclass. A special class
type creates these Class object. The type class is default metaclass which is responsible for making classes.
```


```python
Q2. What is the best way to declare a class's metaclass?
Answer:
When defining a class and no metaclass is defined the default type metaclass will be used. If a metaclass is given and
it is not an instance of type(), then it is used directly as the metaclass.
class A(type):
    pass

class B(metaclass=A):  # for class B, class A is a metaclass
    pass
class C(B):
    pass

print(type(A))
print(type(B))
print(type(C))

<class 'type'>
<class '__main__.A'>
<class '__main__.A'>
```

Q3. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling classes?
Answer:
Both decorators and metaclass have some common things. When we want to aplly some common functionality to attributes of 
the class instances, both can be used. There are some problems which can be solved by decorators as well as by metaclasses.
But there are a few problems that can only be solved by metaclasses. Use of metaclass affects its children while the
decorator affects only the current class.
